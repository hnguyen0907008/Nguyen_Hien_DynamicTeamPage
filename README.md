# Dynamic Team Page Review

Create a Team Bio page based on your partners for the Integrated Project. You’ll
have some standard team copy on the page initially; provide a way to click and
change content for each team member.
This is a small team assignment with designer and developer roles. 

## Description

Because I am from the other level so for this project, I do it solo. I create another team partner as "The Other Person" to demonstrate my JavaScript skill.

The Biography Page is simple. Click buttons to show the Designer's and Developer's information which included their names (headline), images, personal details (p tag) and tools used. 

Only one team member’s information is visible at a time.


### Dependencies

Uses CSS3 and HTML5 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) for reference). Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpilation (or an NPM script).

### Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
