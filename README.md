# Dynamic Team Page Review

Create a Team Bio page based on your partners for the Integrated Project. You’ll
have some standard team copy on the page initially; provide a way to click and
change content for each team member.
This is a small team assignment with designer and developer roles. 

## Description

Because I'm doing the Integrated Project solo so for this Team Page Assignment, I create another team partner referred as "The Other Person" to demonstrate my JavaScript coding skill.

The Biography Page is simple. There are two buttons that show Designer's and Developer's information which included their Name (headline), image and details (p tag).

Only one team member’s information is visible at a time.

## Getting Started

### Dependencies

Uses CSS3 and HTML5 latest features. Be sure to prefix any bleeding-edge rules, tags, etc (see [caniuse](https://caniuse.com/) for reference). Also using latest ES6/next, you should probably think about including [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for transpilation (or an NPM script).

### Installing

cd to the directory of your choice, clone, and hack away!
